This file contains instructions for running and configuring the Peerworks Classification Engine.

Running the Engine
============================================

The classifier can be run using the "classifier" executable. If you performed the "make install"
of the build instructions this is likely in your PATH.

The classifier program supports these options:

 -c CONFIG_FILE 
     Defines the name of the configuration file to use. 
     Defaults to config.conf in the current directory.
 -l LOG_FILE
     Defines where to write log messages to.
     Defaults to classifier.log in the current directory.
 -d
     Forces the classifier to run as a daemon.
     
When the classifier is running, you should be able to access it's http server on whatever
port is defined in the config file, although the responses won't be that useful or friendly
yet.
     
Configuration
============================================

See tests/conf/test.confg in the distribution directory for a
documented example of the configuration file.
