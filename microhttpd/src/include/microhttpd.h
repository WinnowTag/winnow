/**
 * @file microhttpd.h
 * @brief public interface to libmicrohttpd
 * @author Christian Grothoff
 * @author Chris GauthierDickey
 *
 * All symbols defined in this header start with MHD.  MHD is a small
 * HTTP daemon library.  As such, it does not have any API for logging
 * errors (you can only enable or disable logging to stderr).  Also,
 * it may not support all of the HTTP features directly, where
 * applicable, portions of HTTP may have to be handled by clients of
 * the library.<p>
 *
 * The library is supposed to handle everything that it must handle
 * (because the API would not allow clients to do this), such as basic
 * connection management; however, detailed interpretations of headers
 * -- such as range requests -- and HTTP methods are left to clients.
 * The library does understand HEAD and will only send the headers of
 * the response and not the body, even if the client supplied a body.
 * The library also understands headers that control connection
 * management (specifically, "Connection: close" and "Expect: 100
 * continue" are understood and handled automatically).<p>
 *
 * MHD understands POST data and is able to decode certain formats
 * (at the moment only "application/x-www-form-urlencoded") if the
 * entire data fits into the allowed amount of memory for the
 * connection.  Unsupported encodings and large POST submissions are
 * provided as a stream to the main application (and thus can be
 * processed, just not conveniently by MHD).<p>
 *
 * The header file defines various constants used by the HTTP protocol.
 * This does not mean that MHD actually interprets all of these
 * values.  The provided constants are exported as a convenience
 * for users of the library.  MHD does not verify that transmitted
 * HTTP headers are part of the standard specification; users of the
 * library are free to define their own extensions of the HTTP
 * standard and use those with MHD.<p>
 *
 * All functions are guaranteed to be completely reentrant and
 * thread-safe (with the exception of 'MHD_set_connection_value',
 * which must only be used in a particular context).<p>
 *
 * NEW: Before including "microhttpd.h" you should add the necessary
 * includes to define the "uint64_t", "size_t", "fd_set", "socklen_t"
 * and "struct sockaddr" data types (which headers are needed may
 * depend on your platform; for possible suggestions consult
 * "platform.h" in the MHD distribution).
