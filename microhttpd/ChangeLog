Wed Oct 28 20:26:00 CET 2009
 	Releasing libmicrohttpd 0.4.4. -CG

Wed Oct 14 14:37:37 CEST 2009
	Fixing (rare) deadlock due to SELECT missing SIGALRM by
	making all SELECT calls block for at most 1s.  While this
	can in (rare) situations delay the shutdown by 1s, I think
	this is preferable (both performance and possibly portability-wise)
	over using a pipe for the signal. -CG

Sun Oct 11 14:57:29 CEST 2009
	Adding eCos license as an additional license for the
	non-HTTPS code of MHD. -CG

Sun Oct 11 11:24:27 CEST 2009
	Adding support for Symbian. -MR

Fri Oct  9 15:21:29 CEST 2009
	Check for error codes from pthread operations (to help with
	error diagnostics) and abort if something went wrong. -CG

Thu Oct  8 10:43:02 CEST 2009
	Added check for sockets being '< FD_SETSIZE' (just to be safe). -CG

Mon Oct  5 21:17:26 CEST 2009
	Adding "COOKIE" header string #defines. -CG

Mon Oct  5 08:29:06 CEST 2009
	Documenting default values. -CG

Fri Aug 28 22:56:47 CEST 2009
 	Releasing libmicrohttpd 0.4.3. -CG

Sun Aug 23 16:21:35 UTC 2009
	Allow MHD_get_daemon_info to return the daemon's listen socket.
	Includes a test case that uses this functionality to bind a server to
	an OS-assigned port, look the port up with getsockname, and curl it. -DR

Tue Aug  4 00:14:04 CEST 2009
	 Fixing double-call to read from content-reader callback for first
	 data segment (as reported by Alex on the mailinglist). -CG

Thu Jul 29 21:41:52 CEST 2009
 	 Fixed issue with the code not using the "block_size" argument
         given to MHD_create_response_from_callback causing inefficiencies
	 for values < 2048 and segmentation faults for values > 2048
	 (as reported by Andre Colomb on the mailinglist). -CG

Sun May 17 03:29:46 MDT 2009
 	 Releasing libmicrohttpd 0.4.2. -CG

Fri May 15 11:00:20 MDT 2009
	 Grow reserved read buffer more aggressively so that we are not
	 needlessly stuck reading only a handfull of bytes in each iteration. -CG

Thu May 14 21:20:30 MDT 2009
	 Fixed issue where the "NOTIFY_COMPLETED" handler could be called
	 twice (if a socket error or timeout occured for a pipelined
	 connection after successfully completing a request and before
	 the next request was successfully transmitted).  This could
	 confuse applications not expecting to see a connection "complete"
	 that they were never aware of in the first place. -CG

Mon May 11 13:01:16 MDT 2009
         Fixed issue where error code on timeout was "TERMINATED_WITH_ERROR"
         instead of "TERMINATED_TIMEOUT_REACHED". -CG

Wed Apr  1 21:33:05 CEST 2009
         Added MHD_get_version(). -ND

Wed Mar 18 22:59:07 MDT 2009
	 Releasing libmicrohttpd 0.4.1. -CG

Wed Mar 18 17:46:58 MDT 2009
	 Always RECV/SEND with MSG_DONTWAIT to (possibly) address
	 strange deadlock reported by Erik on the mailinglist ---
	 and/or issues with blocking read after select on GNU/Linux
	 (see select man page under bugs). -CG

Tue Mar 17 01:19:50 MDT 2009
	 Added support for thread-pools. -CG/RA

Mon Mar  2 23:44:08 MST 2009
	 Fixed problem with 64-bit upload and download sizes and
	 "-1" being used to indicate "unknown" by introducing
	 new 64-bit constant "MHD_SIZE_UNKNOWN". -CG/DC

Wed Feb 18 08:13:56 MST 2009
	 Added missing #include for build on arm-linux-uclibc. -CG/CC

Mon Feb 16 21:12:21 MST 2009
	 Moved MHD_get_connection_info so that it is always defined,
	 even if HTTPS support is not enabled. -CG

Sun Feb  8 21:15:30 MST 2009
	 Releasing libmicrohttpd 0.4.0. -CG

Thu Feb  5 22:43:45 MST 2009
	 Incompatible API change to allow 64-bit uploads and downloads.
	 Clients must use "uint64_t" for the "pos"
	 argument (MHD_ContentReaderCallback) and the "off"
	 argument (MHD_PostDataIterator) and the "size" 
	 argument (MHD_create_response_from_callback) now.
	 Also, "unsigned int" was changed to "size_t" for
	 the "upload_data_size" argument (MHD_AccessHandlerCallback),
	 the argument to MHD_OPTION_CONNECTION_MEMORY_LIMIT,
	 the "block_size" argument (MHD_create_response_from_callback),
	 the "buffer_size" argument (MHD_create_post_processor) and
	 the "post_data_len" argument (MHD_post_process).  You may
	 need to #include <stdint.h> before <microhttpd.h> from now on. -CG
	
Thu Feb  5 20:21:08 MST 2009
	 Allow getting address information about the connecting
	 client after the accept call. -CG

Mon Feb  2 22:21:48 MST 2009
	 Fixed missing size adjustment for offsets for %-encoded
	 arguments processed by the post processor (Mantis #1447). -CG/SN

Fri Jan 23 16:57:21 MST 2009
	 Support charset specification (ignore) after content-type
	 when post-processing HTTP POST requests (Mantis #1443). -CG/SN

Fri Dec 26 23:08:04 MST 2008
	 Fixed broken check for identical connection address. -CG
	 Making cookie parser more RFC2109 compliant (handle
	 spaces around key, allow value to be optional). -CG

Sat Dec  6 18:36:17 MST 2008
	 Added configure option to disable checking for CURL support.
	 Added MHD_OPTION to allow specification of custom logger. -CG

Tue Nov 18 01:19:53 MST 2008
	 Removed support for untested and/or broken SSL features
	 and (largely useless) options. -CG

Sun Nov 16 16:54:54 MST 2008
	 Added option to get unparsed URI via callback. 
	 Releasing GNU libmicrohttpd 0.4.0pre1. -CG

Sun Nov 16 02:48:14 MST 2008
	 Removed tons of dead code. -CG

Sat Nov 15 17:34:24 MST 2008
	 Added build support for code coverage analysis. -CG

Sat Nov 15 00:31:33 MST 2008
	 Removing (broken) support for HTTPS servers with
	 anonymous (aka "no") certificates as well as
	 various useless dead code. -CG

Sat Nov  8 02:18:42 MST 2008
	 Unset TCP_CORK at the end of transmitting a response
	 to improve performance (on systems where this is
	 supported). -MM

Tue Sep 30 16:48:08 MDT 2008
	 Make MHD useful to Cygwin users; detect IPv6 headers
	 in configure.

Sun Sep 28 14:57:46 MDT 2008
	 Unescape URIs (convert "%ef%e4%45" to "中国"). -CG

Wed Sep 10 22:43:59 MDT 2008
	 Releasing GNU libmicrohttpd 0.4.0pre0. -CG

Wed Sep 10 21:36:06 MDT 2008
	 Fixed data race on closing sockets during 
	 shutdown (in one-thread-per-connection mode). -CG

Thu Sep  4 23:37:18 MDT 2008
	 Fixed some boundary issues with processing
	 chunked requests; removed memmove from a 
	 number of spots, in favor of using an index into 
	 the current buffer instead. -GS

Sun Aug 24 13:05:41 MDT 2008
	 Now handling clients returning 0 from response callback
	 as specified in the documentation (abort if internal
	 select is used, retry immediately if a thread per 
	 connection is used). -CG

Sun Aug 24 12:44:43 MDT 2008
	 Added missing reason phrase. -SG

Sun Aug 24 10:33:22 MDT 2008
	 Fixed bug where MHD failed to transmit the response when
	 the client decided not to send "100 CONTINUE" during
	 a PUT/POST request. -CG

Wed Jul 16 18:54:03 MDT 2008
	 Fixed bug generating chunked responses with chunk sizes
	 greater than 0xFFFFFF (would cause protocol violations). -CG

Mon May 26 13:28:57 MDT 2008
	 Updated and improved documentation.
	 Releasing GNU libmicrohttpd 0.3.1. -CG

Fri May 23 16:54:41 MDT 2008
	 Fixed issue with postprocessor not handling URI-encoded
	 values of more than 1024 bytes correctly. -CG
	
Mon May  5 09:18:29 MDT 2008
	 Fixed date header (was off by 1900 years). -JP

Sun Apr 13 01:06:20 MDT 2008
	 Releasing GNU libmicrohttpd 0.3.0. -CG

Sat Apr 12 21:34:26 MDT 2008
	 Generate an internal server error if the programmer fails
	 to handle upload data correctly.  Tweaked testcases to
	 avoid running into the problem in the testcases.
	 Completed zzuf-based fuzzing testcases.  -CG

Sat Apr 12 15:14:05 MDT 2008
	 Restructured the code (curl-testcases and zzuf testcases
	 are now in different directories; code examples are in
	 src/examples/).
	 Fixed a problem (introduced in 0.2.3) with handling very 
	 large requests (the code did not return proper error code).
	 If "--enable-messages" is specified, the code now includes
	 reasonable default HTML webpages for various build-in
	 errors (such as request too large and malformed requests).
	 Without that flag, the webpages returned will still be
	 empty.
	 Started to add zzuf-based fuzzing-testcases (these require 
	 the zzuf and socat binaries to be installed). -CG

Fri Apr 11 20:20:34 MDT 2008
	 I hereby dub libmicrohttpd a GNU package. -Richard Stallman

Sat Mar 29 22:36:09 MDT 2008
	 Fixed bugs in handling of malformed HTTP requests
	 (causing either NULL dereferences or connections to
	 persist until time-out, if any). -CG

	 Updated and integrated TexInfo documentation. -CG

Tue Mar 25 13:40:53 MDT 2008
	 Prevent multi-part post-processor from going to error 
	 state when the input buffer is full and current token 
	 just changes processor state without consuming any data.
	 Also, the original implementation would not consume any 
	 input in process_value_to_boundary if there is no new 
	 line character in sight. -AS

	 Remove checks for request method after it finished writing
	 response footers as it's only _pipelined_ requests that 
	 should not be allowed after POST or PUT requests.  Reusing 
	 the existing connection is perfectly ok though.  And there 
	 is no reliable way to detect pipelining on server side
	 anyway so it is the client's responsibility to not send new 
	 data before it gets a response after a POST operation. -AS

	 Clarified license in man page. Releasing 
         libmicrohttpd 0.2.3 -CG

Sat Mar 22 01:12:38 MDT 2008
	 Releasing libmicrohttpd 0.2.2. -CG

Mon Feb 25 19:13:53 MST 2008
	 Fixed a problem with sockets closed for reading ending up
	 in the read set under certain circumstances. -CG

Wed Jan 30 23:15:44 MST 2008
	 Added support for nested multiparts to post processor. 
	 Made sure that MHD does not allow pipelining for methods
	 other than HEAD and GET (and of course still also only 
	 allows it for http 1.1).  Releasing libmicrohttpd 0.2.1.  -CG

Mon Jan 21 11:59:46 MST 2008
	 Added option to limit number of concurrent connections 
	 accepted from the same IP address. -CG

Fri Jan  4 16:02:08 MST 2008
	 Fix to properly close connection if application signals
	 problem handling the request. - AS

Wed Jan  2 16:41:05 MST 2008
	 Improvements and bugfixes to post processor implementation. - AS

Wed Dec 19 21:12:04 MST 2007
	 Implemented chunked (HTTP 1.1) downloads (including
	 sending of HTTP footers).  Also allowed queuing of
	 a response early to suppress the otherwise automatic
	 "100 CONTINUE" response.  Removed the mostly useless
	 "(un)register handler" methods from the API.  Changed
	 the internal implementation to use a finite state
	 machine (cleaner code, slightly less memory consumption). 
	 Releasing libmicrohttpd 0.2.0. - CG
	
Sun Dec 16 03:24:13 MST 2007
	 Implemented handling of chunked (HTTP 1.1) uploads.
	 Note that the upload callback must be able to 
	 process chunks in the size uploaded by the client,
	 MHD will not "join" small chunks into a big 
	 contiguous block of memory (even if buffer space
	 would be available).  - CG

Wed Dec  5 21:39:35 MST 2007
	 Fixed race in multi-threaded server mode.
	 Fixed handling of POST data when receiving a
	 "Connection: close" header (#1296).
	 Releasing libmicrohttpd 0.1.2. - CG

Sat Nov 17 00:55:24 MST 2007
	 Fixed off-by-one in error message string matching.
	 Added code to avoid generating SIGPIPE on platforms
	 where this is possible (everywhere else, the main
	 application should install a handler for SIGPIPE).

Thu Oct 11 11:02:06 MDT 2007
	 Releasing libmicrohttpd 0.1.1. - CG

Thu Oct 11 10:09:12 MDT 2007
	 Fixing response to include HTTP status message. - EG 

Thu Sep 27 10:19:46 MDT 2007
	 Fixing parsing of "%xx" in URLs with GET arguments. - eglaysher

Sun Sep  9 14:32:23 MDT 2007
	 Added option to compile debug/warning messages;
	 error messages are now disabled by default.  
	 Modified linker option for GNU LD to not export
	 non-public symbols (further reduces binary size).
	 Releasing libmicrohttpd 0.1.0. - CG

Sat Sep  8 21:54:04 MDT 2007
	 Extended API to allow for incremental POST 
	 processing.  The new API is binary-compatible
	 as long as the app does not handle POSTs, but
	 since that maybe the case, we're strictly speaking
	 breaking backwards compatibility (since url-encoded
	 POST data is no longer obtained the same way). - CG

Thu Aug 30 00:59:24 MDT 2007
	 Improving API to allow clients to associate state 
         with a connection and to be notified about request
         termination (this is a binary-compatible change). - CG
	 Fixed compile errors under OS X. - HL

Sun Aug 26 03:11:46 MDT 2007
	 Added MHD_USE_PEDANTIC_CHECKS option which enforces
	 receiving a "Host:" header in HTTP 1.1 (and sends a
	 HTTP 400 status back if this is violated). - CG

Tue Aug 21 01:01:46 MDT 2007
	 Fixing assertion failure that occured when a client
	 closed the connection after sending some data but
	 not the full headers. - CG

Sat Aug 18 03:06:09 MDT 2007
	 Check for out of memory when adding headers to
	 responses.  Check for NULL key when looking
	 for headers.   If a content reader callback
	 for a response returns zero (has no data yet),
	 do not possibly fall into busy waiting when
	 using external select (with internal selects
	 we have no choice).  - CG

Wed Aug 15 01:46:44 MDT 2007
	 Extending API to allow timeout of connections.
	 Changed API (MHD_create_response_from_callback) to
	 allow user to specify IO buffer size.	 
	 Improved error handling.  
         Released libmicrohttpd 0.0.3. - CG

Tue Aug 14 19:45:49 MDT 2007
	 Changed license to LGPL (with consent from all contributors).
         Released libmicrohttpd 0.0.2. - CG

Sun Aug 12 00:09:26 MDT 2007
	 Released libmicrohttpd 0.0.1. - CG

Fri Aug 10 17:31:23 MDT 2007
	 Fixed problems with handling of responses created from
	 callbacks.  Allowing accept policy callback to be NULL
	 (to accept from all).  Added minimal fileserver example.
	 Only send 100 continue header when specifically requested. - CG

Wed Aug  8 01:46:06 MDT 2007
	 Added pool allocation and connection limitations (total
	 number and memory size).  Released libmicrohttpd 0.0.0. - CG

Tue Jan  9 20:52:48 MST 2007
	 Created project build files and updated API. - CG
