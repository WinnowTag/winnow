Wed Jan 30 23:15:44 MST 2008
	 Added support for nested multiparts to post processor. 
	 Made sure that MHD does not allow pipelining for methods
	 other than HEAD and GET (and of course still also only 
	 allows it for http 1.1).  Releasing libmicrohttpd 0.2.1.  -CG

Mon Jan 21 11:59:46 MST 2008
	 Added option to limit number of concurrent connections 
	 accepted from the same IP address. -CG

Fri Jan  4 16:02:08 MST 2008
	 Fix to properly close connection if application signals
	 problem handling the request. - AS

Wed Jan  2 16:41:05 MST 2008
	 Improvements and bugfixes to post processor implementation. - AS

Wed Dec 19 21:12:04 MST 2007
	 Implemented chunked (HTTP 1.1) downloads (including
	 sending of HTTP footers).  Also allowed queuing of
	 a response early to suppress the otherwise automatic
	 "100 CONTINUE" response.  Removed the mostly useless
	 "(un)register handler" methods from the API.  Changed
	 the internal implementation to use a finite state
	 machine (cleaner code, slightly less memory consumption). 
	 Releasing libmicrohttpd 0.2.0. - CG
	
Sun Dec 16 03:24:13 MST 2007
	 Implemented handling of chunked (HTTP 1.1) uploads.
	 Note that the upload callback must be able to 
	 process chunks in the size uploaded by the client,
	 MHD will not "join" small chunks into a big 
	 contiguous block of memory (even if buffer space
	 would be available).  - CG

Wed Dec  5 21:39:35 MST 2007
	 Fixed race in multi-threaded server mode.
	 Fixed handling of POST data when receiving a
	 "Connection: close" header (#1296).
	 Releasing libmicrohttpd 0.1.2. - CG

Sat Nov 17 00:55:24 MST 2007
	 Fixed off-by-one in error message string matching.
	 Added code to avoid generating SIGPIPE on platforms
	 where this is possible (everywhere else, the main
	 application should install a handler for SIGPIPE).

Thu Oct 11 11:02:06 MDT 2007
	 Releasing libmicrohttpd 0.1.1. - CG

Thu Oct 11 10:09:12 MDT 2007
	 Fixing response to include HTTP status message. - EG 

Thu Sep 27 10:19:46 MDT 2007
	 Fixing parsing of "%xx" in URLs with GET arguments. - eglaysher

Sun Sep  9 14:32:23 MDT 2007
	 Added option to compile debug/warning messages;
	 error messages are now disabled by default.  
	 Modified linker option for GNU LD to not export
	 non-public symbols (further reduces binary size).
	 Releasing libmicrohttpd 0.1.0. - CG

Sat Sep  8 21:54:04 MDT 2007
	 Extended API to allow for incremental POST 
	 processing.  The new API is binary-compatible
	 as long as the app does not handle POSTs, but
	 since that maybe the case, we're strictly speaking
	 breaking backwards compatibility (since url-encoded
	 POST data is no longer obtained the same way). - CG

Thu Aug 30 00:59:24 MDT 2007
	 Improving API to allow clients to associate state 
         with a connection and to be notified about request
         termination (this is a binary-compatible change). - CG
	 Fixed compile errors under OS X. - HL

Sun Aug 26 03:11:46 MDT 2007
	 Added MHD_USE_PEDANTIC_CHECKS option which enforces
	 receiving a "Host:" header in HTTP 1.1 (and sends a
	 HTTP 400 status back if this is violated). - CG

Tue Aug 21 01:01:46 MDT 2007
	 Fixing assertion failure that occured when a client
	 closed the connection after sending some data but
	 not the full headers. - CG

Sat Aug 18 03:06:09 MDT 2007
	 Check for out of memory when adding headers to
	 responses.  Check for NULL key when looking
	 for headers.   If a content reader callback
	 for a response returns zero (has no data yet),
	 do not possibly fall into busy waiting when
	 using external select (with internal selects
	 we have no choice).  - CG

Wed Aug 15 01:46:44 MDT 2007
	 Extending API to allow timeout of connections.
	 Changed API (MHD_create_response_from_callback) to
	 allow user to specify IO buffer size.	 
	 Improved error handling.  
         Released libmicrohttpd 0.0.3. - CG

Tue Aug 14 19:45:49 MDT 2007
	 Changed license to LGPL (with consent from all contributors).
         Released libmicrohttpd 0.0.2. - CG

Sun Aug 12 00:09:26 MDT 2007
	 Released libmicrohttpd 0.0.1. - CG

Fri Aug 10 17:31:23 MDT 2007
	 Fixed problems with handling of responses created from
	 callbacks.  Allowing accept policy callback to be NULL
	 (to accept from all).  Added minimal fileserver example.
	 Only send 100 continue header when specifically requested. - CG

Wed Aug  8 01:46:06 MDT 2007
	 Added pool allocation and connection limitations (total
	 number and memory size).  Released libmicrohttpd 0.0.0. - CG

Tue Jan  9 20:52:48 MST 2007
	 Created project build files and updated API. - CG
